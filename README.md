# Waterguy12
## Story
This started out as a bot which responded with "/u/waterguy12" on new memes. Waterguy12 [went on vacation and wanted to keep updated on all the new memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/6qij1u/meirl/).

While I was developing this bot, someone else made [/u/waterguy12 tag bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/waterguy12_tag_bot) which already responded "/u/waterguy12" on all the memes om [/r/me_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/).
Therefore I changed my bot to say "Good bot" to all replies from /u/wateguy12_tag_Bot
## Using it yourself
If you want to use parts of these bot, feel free. Keep in mind that you'll have to supply your own credentials. [Here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html)'s a tutorial on how to do that. Follow the one which says "Script Application"
